	<p class="body">
CANU is a sweet messenger app that helps you get together with your friends - fast and simple. Create an activity, notify your friends, sort out details, and get together for the fun. It has always been harder.
</p>
<p class="header">What has been harder ?</p>
<p class="body">
Today we mostly use SMS and/or group chats to plan. With SMS we answer the same questions over and over: At what time? Who's coming? What's the door code?</br>With group chats the activity is often lost among all the messages and it's a hassle to create a group every time you want to do something.
</p>
<p class="header">It's just about doing something</p>
<p class="body">
The focus is purely on what you plan on doing. Nothing else. Just choose and discuss whatever you want to do.
