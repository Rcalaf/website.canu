	<p class="intro_header">What is CANU ? </p>
	<p class="body">
CANU is a sweet messenger app that helps you get together with your friends - fast and simple. Create an activity, notify your friends, sort out details, and get together for the fun. It has always been harder.
</p>
<p class="header">What hassle ?</p>
<p class="body">
Today we mostly use sms and/or group chats to plan. With SMS we answer the same questions over and over. What's the time? Who's coming? Where's it at? </br>With group chats the activity is often lost among all the messages and it's a hassle to create a group every time you want to do something.
