	<p class="body">It all started when we moved to Stockholm and met at <a href="http://www.hyperisland.com" target="_blank" class="intext">Hyper Island</a>.<br/><br/> As much as we liked Stockholm, we quickly found a problem - there is no easy way of getting together with people and finding new things to do. We started working on CANU.</p>

				I grew up on a small farm in the south of Sweden called
Tillytorp, which was my home for 18 years. I’ve always been a thinker and a problem solver with a love for challenges and finding great solution to a difficult problem. As a kid I wanted to become an inventor for that reason alone. I am ambitious, fearless
and determined and right now I’m exploring my surroundings at Hyper Island, throwing myself out there and loving it.</p>

				Born and raised in Barcelona. I love playing soccer, sailing
and motor sports. I really enjoy the nature and outdoor activities. Since my first contact with MSX and BASIC at the age of 7 I’ve always been interested in the art of coding, that’s why I chose the developers path. I once started a business that sold caviar but that only ended up in a great friendship. Now I’m exploring my creative side and having fun developing great ideas at Hyper Island.

				Shaped up in the sunny side of Southern Russia, I was
surrounded by art, sport and nature in my early life. I lived in Montreal and Vancouver where I studied Graphic Design and Marketing. I am an initiator, solution designer and a dreamer. I love to challenge everything that follows the norm. I love electronic music, mountains, racing and great times with awesome people.</p>

				Brought up on the west coast of Sweden, I wanted to become a soccer pro growing up but in my teens I decided to pursue a career as a musician. I studied economics and marketing in collage and started my first band at the age of 15. We signed deals with Warner Music and Universal. I am an initiator, a social genius and ambitious. I'm a team player with a positive attitude and I get motivated when amazing people do great stuff together.</p>
