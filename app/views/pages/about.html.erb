		How it all started. What took us here.
	</p>
	<p class="header">Meatballs and vodka at the beach? Not always.<p>
	<p class="body">
	
	We met, while studying at a pretty cool place called <a href="http://www.hyperisland.com" target="_blank" class="intext">Hyper Island</a>. We quickly abandoned the idea of working in the advertising industry, thus found our baby - CANU. We are a dangerous Russian, a lazy Spaniard and a Swedish farmer, from a country called Skåne. Vitali, Roger and Didrik. 
	
	<br/><br/> 
	
	 We all happened to like people. What do people want? What do we want? What is the next coolest tool that we can invent? How can we make a killer service? 
	 </p>
	 <p class="quote">“...if it has something to do with getting together. We are there.”</p>

	 <p class="header">First. How the hell do you get to know local Swedes?</p>
	  
	  <p class="body"> It's quite impossible. Our Brazilian friend Caio is even ready to <a href="http://www.furniturefellowship.se" target="_blank" class="intext">assemble IKEA furniture</a>, just to get to know you. How desperate are we? We just went for an app. What else. 
	 <br/><br/> We want everyone to loose their social virginity - to start talking to each other. Yes, to complete strangers. Not randomly bumping into one another in the metro, but by sharing some hidden passions with everyone else in the city. We love openness, fearlessness and risk-taking. The <b>Local</b> feed is exactly what we started with. Just fly around and find the other so called soul-mates. Whether it's drinking, fooling around, having fika or going fishing. Whatever makes one happy - we want everyone to share it and find each other.
	 
	  </p>
	 <p class="header">We are not only after the strange</p>
	 <p class="body">	
	  We did not forget about our friends and your friends. How can we spend more time together? Annoyed by the inefficiency of texting and un-human Facebook events, we got down to <b>Tribes</b>. These are the groups of people we spend time together with and meet occasionally. It is tough to keep track of what everyone is doing in the future. That's what is been put in place.
