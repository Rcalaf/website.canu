<p class="header"> General Conditions</p>
<p class="body">
<b>1.</b>We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or your access to the Service for any reason, without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. If we terminate your access to the Service your activities, comments, friendships, and all other data will no longer be accessible through your account (e.g., users will not be able to navigate to your username and view your activities), but those materials and data may persist and appear within the Service (e.g., if  users already attended your activities).
<br/><br/>
<b>2.</b>
Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately cease.
<br/><br/>

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use ("Updated Terms") from time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we will provide reasonable advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.
<br/><br/>
<b>4.</b>
We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any time.

<br/><br/>
<b>7.</b>
You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline. You agree that CANU is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user.

<br/><br/>
<b>8.</b>
There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from the Service, to third-party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites or features in images or comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party content that we do not control, maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit interactions between the Service and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For example, the Service may include a feature that enables you to share Content from the Service or your Content with a third party, which may be publicly posted on that third party's service or application. Using this functionality typically requires you to login to your account on the third-party service and you do so at your own risk. CANU does not control any of these third-party web services or any of their content. You expressly acknowledge and agree that CANU is in no way responsible or liable for any such third-party services or features. YOUR CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD PARTIES FOUND THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD PARTY. You may choose, at your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application") and such Application may interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your Service profile. By using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you use an Application to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the Service being shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to be publicly disclosed and/or associated with you, even if CANU has not itself provided such information; and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the CANU Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.

<p class="header">Rights</p>
<p class="body">
<b>1.</b>
CANU does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, you hereby grant to CANU a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service, subject to the Service's Privacy Policy, available here http://www.canu.se/privacy including but not limited to sections 3 ("Sharing of Your Information"), 4 ("How We Store Your Information"), and 5 ("Your Choices About Your Information"). You can choose who can view your Content and activities, including your photos, as described in the Privacy Policy.
<br/><br/>
<b>2.</b>
Although it is CANU's intention for the Service to be available as much as possible, there will be occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and/or equipment. Also, CANU reserves the right to remove any Content from the Service for any reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service may continue to be stored by CANU, including, without limitation, in order to comply with certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, CANU encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, CANU is not a backup service and you agree that you will not rely on the Service for the purposes of Content backup or storage. CANU will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of any Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and that the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.
<br/><br/>
<b>3.</b>
Except as otherwise described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available at http://www.canu.se/privacy, as between you and CANU, any Content will be non-confidential and non-proprietary and we will not be liable for any use or disclosure of Content. You acknowledge and agree that your relationship with CANU is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does not place CANU in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general public, including with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of CANU, and CANU will not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Content you provide.
<br/><br/>
<b>4.</b>It is CANU's policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific terms, conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your ideas are similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly, CANU does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for any materials or ideas so transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content, information, ideas, suggestions, or other materials, you further agree that CANU is free to use any such content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing and marketing products and services, without any liability or payment of any kind to you.
